# reactive-PD
Simulation for reactive strategies in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

This is a MATLAB implementation of the simulation presented in the 1992 paper "Tit for tat in heterogeneous populations"
by Nowak and Sigmund. It allows reproducing the results presented in the paper or running the same experiment with different
parameter values (payoff values, populations size).

Start with the script "TFT_in_a_heterogeneous_population.m" which runs the simulation exactly as presented in the article
and produces the same figures.
